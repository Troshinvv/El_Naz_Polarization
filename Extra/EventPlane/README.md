# MCtests 

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

This is an overview of possible MC tests, which one can perform on the analyzed dataset.

## Procedure

Firstly, one can use MCTracks to obtain distributions of global polarization of hyperons (-`$P_{y}$`).
Then, the average value of global polarization can be obtained from the fitting of angular distribution of daughter particle (e.g. proton for Lambda hyperon).

The script collects all the proton, which come from decays of Lambda.
