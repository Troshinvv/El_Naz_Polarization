# Polarization Analysis Framework

Framework for global polarization analysis within mpdroot 

For this analysis the MC-Glauber based centrality framework is utilized in order to calibrate centrality (developed by P. Parfenov et al, NRNU MEPhI for the MPD collaboration). Here I will make a short overview of the procedure, including a few modifications that were introduced, please see the following link for the detailed description of the framework: [https://github.com/FlowNICA/CentralityFramework](https://github.com/FlowNICA/CentralityFramework)
